# AI Travel Planner App

This app is a travel planning assistant that uses AI to recommend personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences and travel history.

## Features

* User authentication and authorization
* User profile management
* Travel destination recommendation
* Travel booking

## AI Model
The NCF model stands for Neural Collaborative Filtering, a deep learning-based approach for recommender systems. NCF models the interaction between users and items (like movies, products, etc.) using neural networks, allowing for more complex and non-linear relationships.

* [Expo](https://expo.dev/) for the app's frontend
* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for the app's mobile app
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for the app's backend
